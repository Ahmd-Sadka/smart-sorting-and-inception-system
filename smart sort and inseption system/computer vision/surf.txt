The `matchFeatures` function in MATLAB is used to match features between two images. 
It takes two feature sets as input and returns a set of index pairs that correspond 
to the matching features in the two sets.

The `matchFeatures` function uses a nearest-neighbor approach to match features.
For each feature in the first set, it finds the closest feature in the second set 
based on Euclidean distance between the feature descriptors. It then applies a ratio test to determine 
if the match is reliable. Specifically, it checks if the distance to the closest feature is sufficiently smaller 
than the distance to the second closest feature. If the ratio of the two distances is below a certain threshold, 
the match is considered valid.

The output of `matchFeatures` is a matrix of index pairs, where each row corresponds to a valid match
between a feature in the first set and a feature in the second set. The first column of each row is 
the index of the feature in the first set, and the second column is the index of the feature in the second set.

In the context of the code I provided, `matchFeatures` is used to match the SURF features
in the captured image with the SURF features in the reference image.

The resulting index pairs are used to determine if the Pepsi can is present in the captured image.
